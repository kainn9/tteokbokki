# tteokbokki(WIP)
A basic 2D physics library for Go, inspired by the [Pikuma C++ course](https://pikuma.com/courses/game-physics-engine-programming), and written in an ECS-based fashion.

### Very Basic Interactive [Example](https://www.kainan.io/tteokbokki.html)

### Random Todos:
- CleanUp/Comments []
- Remove Warm start? []
- More robust example 
    - Toggle for what type of shape to create(currently random) []
    - Add examples of forces(water/drag, attraction, spring) []
    - Maybe a Rope like object using Joint Constraints []
    - A Controllable RigidBody(player like object) []
    - Ability to toggle between solver and resolver []
    - Ability to turn off collision resolution + Gravity and draw contacts []

- ctype errors/guard on resolver/Solver[]
- Simple Vert solver![]
- A simple example(one file)
- Proper ReadMe(docs + design explanations) []
- Consider contact/manifold caching []
- Consider adding something for Tunneling/Continuous detection for small fast moving objects []
